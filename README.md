### These breakfasts will provide you with an opportunity to:

* Learn about bioinformatics training opportunities and community resources available
* Discuss bioinformatics-related questions
* Help foster a local bioinformatics community
* Get to know the HBC analysts and trainers, in addition to members from other facilities associated with bioinformatics research (in one way or another), including:
  * [Single Cell Core](https://singlecellcore.hms.harvard.edu/)

### 

There is no registration for attending these, but seating and food will be available on a first-come-first-served basis. This is a time to get together without computers and we welcome anyone with bioinformatics questions or just an interest in bioinformatics, in addition to other bioinformaticians looking for a community. You don’t have to stay for the entire breakfast, but we plan to have introductions at 9:30am.
